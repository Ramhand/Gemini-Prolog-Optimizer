# Gemini-Prolog-Optimizer
A basic search algorithm to be used on pre-clustered feature space data from Gemini-Contrast.

A Prolog-based search algorithm meant to catch and correct errors on a pretrained Gemini-Contrast models.  By leveraging logic programming, the goal is to enhance efficiency and accuracy by identifying troublesome areas of the feature space and to create a set of rules to correct probable errors.  Included thus far is the hypothesis space and the search algorithm itself, both in their basic implementations.  Will be updated as I move forward with testing and implementation of appropriate clustering algorithms in the attempts to further the art of image classification.
